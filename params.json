Beware!\r\n\r\n大家都将高呼：“当心！当心！\r\n\r\nHis flashing eyes, his floating hair!\r\n\r\n瞧他飘扬的头发，闪亮的眼睛！\r\n\r\nWeave a circle round him thrice,\r\n\r\n我们要绕他巡行三圈，\r\n\r\nAnd close your eyes with holy dread,\r\n\r\n在神圣的恐惧中闭上双眼，\r\n\r\nFor he on honey-dew hath fed,\r\n\r\n因为他尝过蜜的露水，\r\n\r\nAnd drunk the milk of Paradise.\r\n\r\n饮过乐园里的乳泉。\r\n```\r\n","name":"time freewheeling"}

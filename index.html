<pre><code>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

忽必烈汗驾临“上都”，

A stately pleasure-dome decree: 

修起富丽的逍遥宫，

Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

那儿有神河阿尔浮

Through caverns measureless to man

流经深不可测的岩洞，

Down to a sunless sea.

注入不见太阳的海中。

So twice five miles of fertile ground

那儿有十哩方圆的沃土，

With walls and towers were girdled round:

城墙、高塔四面围绕，

And here were gardens bright with sinuous rills

明媚的花园，曲折的小溪，

Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; 

丁香、豆蔻芳华四溢，

And here were forests ancient as the hills, 

树林像山丘一样古老，

Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. 

环抱着阳光灿烂的草地。但沿着松柏苍苍的山坡

But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted

但沿着松柏苍苍的山坡

Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! 

急转直下，却是悬崖深谷！

A savage place! as holy and enchanted 

一片荒芜！好像施过魔术，

As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted

会有女子在下弦月下出没，

By woman wailing for her demon-lover!

为她的恶魔情人哀哭！

And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,

深谷里煮沸了一锅骚乱，

As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,

仿佛大地在急促地气喘，

A mighty fountain momently was forced;

一股强大的喷泉不时腾空，

Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst

在它一阵阵爆发之中

Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,

巨石弹起，如同冰雹，

Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:

如同谷粒在连枷之下蹦跳！

And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever

在这些石块的狂舞中，

It flung up momently the sacred river.

有时神河也被高高抛起，

Five miles meandering with a mazy motion

它扭成五哩蜿蜓的迷宫，

Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,

它穿过森林和谷地，

Then reached the caverns measureless to man,

到达深不可测的岩洞，

And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:

喧哗着沉入死水洋底。

And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far

忽必烈汗远远谛听，在喧哗中

Ancestral voices prophesying war!

听到祖先的声音在预言战争！

The shadow of the dome of pleasure,

逍遥宫的影子青幽，

Floated midway on the waves:

在波浪之中漂流，

Where was heard the mingled measure

喷泉与岩洞交响，

From the fountain and the caves.

构成韵律的重奏

It was a miracle of rare device,

奇迹在此汇集，鬼斧神工，

A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

阳光灿烂的宫和冰的岩洞！

A damsel with a dulcimer

我梦幻中看见

In a vision once I saw: 

一个操琴的女郎——

It was an Abyssinian maid,

阿比西尼亚姑娘，

And on her dulcimer she played,

她轻轻拨动琴弦，

Singing of Mount Abora. 

把阿波拉山吟唱。

Could I revive within me

啊，但愿我能在心底

Her symphony and song,

把她的乐曲和歌声复制。

To such a deep delight 't would win me

那时我就会如醉如痴，

That with music loud and long,

我只消用那悠扬的仙乐

I would build that dome in air,

就能重建那天宫瑶池，

That sunny dome! those caves of ice!

那阳光灿烂的宫和冰的洞窟！

And all who heard should see them there,

凡是聆听者都将目睹，

And all should cry, Beware! Beware!

大家都将高呼：“当心！当心！

His flashing eyes, his floating hair!

瞧他飘扬的头发，闪亮的眼睛！

Weave a circle round him thrice,

我们要绕他巡行三圈，

And close your eyes with holy dread,

在神圣的恐惧中闭上双眼，

For he on honey-dew hath fed,

因为他尝过蜜的露水，

And drunk the milk of Paradise.

饮过乐园里的乳泉。
